            <br>
            <p>A wide variety of leathers are used to make shoe uppers and it's not always easy to clearly
                differentiate between the types. The most common types of leather are pigmented smooth leather
                (pigment
                binder coating on the grain side), aniline leather (open pore grain side leather), waxed or oiled
                leather, suede and nubuck. Vegetable-tanned cow hide is commonly processed for sole leather. In
                Europe,
                footwear manufacturers are required to clearly state the type of materials and processes.

                The shoe industry is the world's largest user of leathers, manufacturing 14 billion pairs of leather
                shoes a year. Of these some 11.5 billion are made in Asian factories with 8 billion pairs coming
                from
                China alone, making it the biggest producer. By comparison, only 26 million pairs of shoes are
                produced
                in Germany and roughly 5 million pairs of shoes are made in the UK (discounting the two main
                producers
                ‘New Balance’ & ‘Hotter’ (britishfootwearassociation.co.uk).

                Top of the shoe-buying tree is the USA. Statistically, every American buys six pairs of shoes every
                year. In Europe, Japan and Canada, consumers purchase between three and five pairs per year, whereas
                the
                average Chinese customer buys 2.5 pairs of shoes per year.

                In Germany, every woman has 17.3 pairs of shoes at home and men have 8.2 pairs (according to a
                survey
                carried out in 2014). This statistic is also confirmed by the output behavior. According to a study
                from
                2015, women spend twice as much on shoes as men. </p>

                Shoes are made from many different materials and in infinite colours and shapes. In the early days,
                the
                shape and appearance of a shoe was solely to protect the foot against injuries and the climate.
                However,
                in more modern times shoe styles have been heavily influenced by fashion and used to display the
                status
                of the wearer. As well as being more comfortable and better suited to the weather, modern footwear
                is
                specially designed for specific uses, including women's and men's shoes, slippers, sneakers, boots,
                hiking boots, sandals and much more.

                Throughout the centuries, leather has been the primary material for shoes, mainly because it was
                always
                available in sufficient quantities. Today, although a variety of materials are used to make
                footwear,
                leather is still paramount, for a number of reasons. It can be formed, sewn, and made waterproof
                without
                losing its breathability. It is also very robust and offers excellent protection against foot
                injuries.
                You will never sweat as much in leather shoes, compared to those made from other materials. While
                fabric
                is also breathable, its waterproofing qualities and the level of protection it provides against
                injuries
                is significantly inferior to leather. Through these superior properties leather, is still the best
                material for shoes. Most substitute materials are processed solely for price reasons.</p>

            <h3>If you've never worn a pair of leather shoes for work, then you're missing out. </h3>
            <h1>Keys on Picking the Right High Heels</h1>
            <p>Leather shoes are a popular favourite for people who have active jobs or need shoes that will give
                their
                feet extra comfort and protection. However, some people don't like buying leather because it usually
                has
                a higher price tag
                compared to other synthetic materials.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Yes, the price is usually higher but that's because there are so
                many benefits of leather shoes. Here's why leather shoes are the best shoes for work.</h3>

                <h3>Make sure you get the right fit.</h3>
                <p>The first and most significant step in choosing the perfect pair of high heels is choosing
                    the right size. It can be very uncomfortable and painful for your feet if the size is too
                    small. On the other hand, if the pair is too big, you might end up
                    pausing every single step because your shoes keep on getting loose. </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="tips">
                <h3>1. Breathability</h3>
                <p>Did you know leather breathes? Not like <em>actual</em> breathing but rather it lets air pass
                    through the
                    material. This is great for leather shoes because the material lets air in to cool your feet and
                    stop
                    them from smelling.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="b" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>2. Durability</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest benefits of leather shoes is they are durable. Genuine leather shoes can
                    outlive other
                    shoes made from synthetic materials. High quality leather&nbsp;stays strong against demanding
                    work
                    environments meaning the shoes will last much longer. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Some people may get put off spending more for leather shoes but because they last longer, they
                    are an
                    investment. Buying one pair of leather shoes can be cheaper than having to buy two pairs of
                    synthetic&nbsp;shoes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="c" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>3. Water Resistance</h3>
                <p>If the leather is treated or waxed then it will be resistant against water and other liquids.
                    When
                    working outside or in kitchens, you need to wear shoes that are water resistant to keep your
                    feet dry
                    and avoid any external damage to the shoe. Leather shoes can keep your toes dry from any spills
                    or
                    puddles.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="d" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>4. Extra Protection</h3>
                <p>Of course leather shoes won't give you the same protection as steel toe
                    cap or composite capped shoes</a> but the strength of the natural material can offer extra
                    protection from hot liquids and small falling objects. If you work in an active work
                    environment,
                    leather can help protect your feet from accidents or injuries.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="e" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>5. Better Fit</h3>
                <p>If you wear leather shoes, the leather material will mould&nbsp;to the shape of your foot. When
                    trying on
                    plastic or other synthetic shoes you can find they often feel hard against your feet and they
                    won't
                    change to accommodate the shape of your feet. You might think that's a good thing, but it's not.
                    As not
                    everyone's feet are exactly the same, leather can adapt to your foot shape, giving your feet
                    extra
                    comfort and support.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="f" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>6. Comfort</h3>
                <p>As well as being a naturally&nbsp;strong material, leather is also very comfortable. Leather
                    shoes offer
                    comfort and support for your feet. Finding the right shoes is very important to avoid
                    injuring&nbsp;your back. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="g" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>7. Easy to Clean</h3>
                <p>Compared to other fabrics that can be difficult to clean, leather is easy to wash down with a
                    damp cloth.
                    Because the material is breathable, leather products aren't difficult to dry either after they
                    have been
                    washed.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="h" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>8. Style</h3>
                <p>Genuine leather looks stylish, you can't deny it. Shoes made from manufactured materials can
                    often look
                    plastic and unnatural. Leather naturally makes shoes and clothes look like a luxury item because
                    the
                    material is sleek and shiny.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="i" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>9. Eco-Friendly</h3>
                <p>Clothes made from synthetic&nbsp;fibres and fabrics have been considered as damaging to the
                    environment
                    during the manufacturing process as they release harmful gases. &nbsp;As leather is a natural
                    material,
                    no harmful chemicals were used to create it - making it eco-friendly!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <a id="j" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
                <h3>10. Smells good</h3>
                <p>Nothing beats the smell of genuine leather. After buying a bag or jacket made of synthetic
                    leather, you
                    can find it has an odd smell. Man-made materials are usually made with different chemicals that
                    make
                    them have a strange stink. The smell of synthetic shoes can be made worse if your feet have a
                    habit of
                    smelling after a long shift.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, your nose is far away from your feet but it's not nice walking around knowing your
                    feet are
                    smelling unpleasant. As&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent;">leather is a natural
                        product,
                        it has a natural and refreshing scent. If you've never smelled genuine leather before, have
                        a smell
                        next time you're in a clothes shop - just make sure nobody is nearby, they might think
                        you're
                        weird.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many benefits to wearing leather shoes, especially for work. Leather gives you extra
                    comfort
                    and protection so you don't have to worry about your shoes. When you're working long hours, you
                    don't
                    want to worry about your shoes falling apart beneath your feet. Having a pair of genuine leather
                    <a href="https://www.sfceurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shoes for work</a> is an
                    investment
                    that will keep your feet feeling comfortable throughout your entire shift.
