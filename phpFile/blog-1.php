                <h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Shoe Packing Strategy</strong></h2>
                <br>
                <p>Before a trip, we often make preparations for the trip, such as clothes, daily necessities and our
                    topic
                    today - shoes. The problem of choosing shoes for travel can seem overwhemling at first, but don't
                    panic,
                    you can have comfort and style without bringing millions of shoes for a travel. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: center"><strong>I suggest to group travel shoes in three categories: hiking,
                        walking
                        and sandals.</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I recommend that when carrying shoes of the same type, there should be no more than two pairs of
                    shoes of
                    that type, one of which is for the foot, of course. This decision will allow us to reduce our travel
                    pack and avoid the shoeless embarrassment of an accident during the trip. Next, I will introduce you
                    to
                    these three types of shoes.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Hiking Shoes:</strong></h3>
                <br>
                <p><img src="../images/blogImg/pexels-craig-adderley-1467574.jpg" width="483" height="301" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Hiking boots are actually the most versatile of the three types of shoes. Because of the special
                    design
                    of their shoes, they can be used in almost any situation on the road. The great thing about these
                    shoes
                    is that the leather material provides some water resistance, while the hard nature of leather shoes
                    is
                    good for protecting the feet from injury. It will be your best friend if your trip includes some
                    wild
                    activities such as the mountains.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Walking Shoes:</strong></h3>
                <p><img src="../images/blogImg/pexels-ricardo-esquivel-3011520.jpg" width="484" height="443" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Walking shoes always are a great option for city travel because they are
                    lightweight, comfortable, and can be casual or dressy. In fact, a cool-looking pair of sneakers
                    is our preferred travel shoe in most cases. Also, a one-day city travel can easily cover a distance
                    of
                    10 kilometers. Traveling in a busy city can always involve long waiting times in line. Queuing in
                    line
                    for tickets and in line for transportation makes our feet ache. Therefore, wearing a comfortable
                    pair of
                    sneakers can lighten the burden on your feet.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><strong>Sandals:</strong></h3>
                <br>
                <p><img src="../images/blogImg/pexels-pixabay-40737.jpg" width="490" height="276" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Among the three type of shoes, sandals gets the higest rating in the terms of comfortable and
                    lightweight. Having a solid pair of sandals will let your feet breathe while still offering comfort
                    and
                    support. Usually, people wear sandals in warmer climates or during warmer parts of the year during
                    travelling to keep their feet cool and dry. While travel in South-East Asia, sandals can even be
                    used as
                    everyday walking shoes.</p>

                <div class="tips">
                    <h2>Prioritize Comfort</h2>
                    <p>Comfort is the most important factor when looking to buy travel shoes. Whether your holiday
                        involves
                        long
                        hikes or sightseeing, you want something that is comfortable. Look for something decent,
                        casual, and most importantly comfortable.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="tips">
                    <h2>Do Consider the Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Hiking boots or tactical boots provide the best support to your feet and ankles. You must also
                        considerthe climatic conditions of the area if it's humid or chilly. You might want to invest in
                        a
                        pair that
                        performs all these functions or you might want the best two for your trip.</p>

                    <h2>Check whether Your Choosen Shoes Gurantee Durability </h2>
                    <p>The material and sewing are the biggest indicators of any footwear's durability. Besides, look
                        for
                        qualities like grip, soles, flexibility around the toes, if the shoes are adjustable to
                        different
                        weathers.</p>
